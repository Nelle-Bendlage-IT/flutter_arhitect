# Flutter Architect

A powerful tool designed to simplify app development by providing a visual representation of the architecture.

This tool is ment to be a powerful and intuitive solution for designing, visualizing, and generating code for an app based on the arhitecure. By providing a clear visual representation of the app's structure and automating code generation, the goal is to enable developers to focus on other aspects of app development, resulting in more efficient and maintainable projects.
